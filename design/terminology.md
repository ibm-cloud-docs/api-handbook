# Terminology

This section applies to the names of model field names, URL segment names, query parameter names,
and enumeration value names. In this document, these are collectively referred to as "names."

## Formatting

Names MUST be lower snake case. This format is defined as one or more lowercase words separated by
the underscore character (`_`). These names MUST NOT begin with an underscore or number.

## Abbreviations

Names MUST NOT contain abbreviations which are not industry-standard. Where industry-standard
abbreviations are used, they MUST be used consistently.

## Brand names

Brand names and code names SHOULD be avoided in field names, URL segment names, and query parameter
names. Brand names MAY be used in enumeration value names, if necessary. Where possible, resources
and resource fields SHOULD be named with industry-standard, widely-understood terms.
