# Errors
{: #errors}

In the event that a request cannot be fulfilled, the server MUST return an appropriate `400`-series
or `500`-series status code. More information on when specific status codes should be used can be
found in the [Status Codes](/docs/api-handbook?topic=api-handbook-status-codes) section. If a `400`-series or
`500`-series status code is returned, the response body MUST be an error container model.

Any `500` or `503` response made in production MUST be logged and treated as a critical failure
requiring an emergency fix. There MUST NOT be long-running known causes for `500` or `503` status
errors.

## Error container model
{: #error-container-model}

An error response (any response with `400`- or `500`-series status code) MUST return an error
container model. This model MUST contain an `errors` field, SHOULD contain a `trace` field, and MAY
contain a `status_code` field, as outlined below:

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `errors` | Error Model Array | This field MUST contain an array with at least one error model. |
| `trace` | String | This field SHOULD contain a lowercase UUID uniquely identifying the request. |
| `status_code` | Integer | This field MAY contain the HTTP status code used for the response. Otherwise, it MUST be omitted. |

## Error model
{: #error-model}

An error model MUST contain a `code` and a `message` field, SHOULD contain a `more_info` field, and
MAY contain a `target` field, as outlined below:

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `code` | Enumeration | This field MUST contain a snake case string succinctly identifying the problem. This field SHOULD NOT indicate which field, parameter, or header caused the error, as this is better done with an error target model. |
| `message` | String | This field MUST contain a plainly-written, developer-oriented explanation of the solution to the problem in complete, well-formed sentences. |
| `more_info` | URL | This field SHOULD contain a publicly-accessible URL where information about the error can be read in a web browser. |
| `target` | Error Target Model | This field MAY contain an error target model. Otherwise, it MUST be omitted. |
{: caption="Error model" caption-side="bottom"}

The error model MAY be extended with additional fields to better specify the error. The `target`
field can be considered a standardized example of such an extension.

## Error target model
{: #error-target-model}

An error target model MUST contain the fields outlined below:

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `type` | Enumeration | This field MUST contain `field`, `parameter`, or `header`. |
| `name` | String | This field MUST contain the name of the problematic field (with dot-syntax if necessary), query parameter, or header. |

### Example error response
{: #example-error-response}

```json
{
  "trace": "9daee671-916a-4678-850b-10b911f0236d",
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "missing_field",
      "message": "The `first_name` field is required.",
      "more_info": "https://docs.api.example.com/v2/users/create_user#first_name",
      "target": {
        "type": "field",
        "name": "first_name"
      }
    },
    {
      "code": "reserved_value",
      "message": "The value provided for `username` is already in use.",
      "more_info": "https://docs.api.example.com/v2/users/create_user#username",
      "target": {
        "type": "field",
        "name": "username"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Codes and messages
{: #codes-and-messages}

Error `code` values SHOULD specify the problem that caused an error; `message` values SHOULD
describe the problem and MAY also provide suggestions or solutions.

### Codes
{: #codes}

Error `code` values MUST be snake case strings, descriptive of the problem encountered, as succinct
as possible, and absent of any non-standard or proprietary terms, brands, codenames, abbreviations,
or acronyms.

`code` values SHOULD NOT prescribe solutions to problems. For example, `color_must_be_red_or_blue`
is not a good `code`. A better `code` would be `invalid_color`, leaving solutions to `message`
values. This allows `code` values to remain constant even if a field becomes more permissive in the
future.

A `code` value, along with any other machine-readable fields included in an error, SHOULD be
specific enough for client code to take any required action. Client code should not be forced to
parse a human-readable `message` value in order to take action on a specific error condition.

The documentation for specific requests SHOULD enumerate possible error `code` values. Adding a
possible error `code` for a request SHOULD be considered a breaking change. For this reason, the
documentation MAY include possible error `code` values which are not yet used.

### Messages
{: #messages}

Error `message` values SHOULD describe the problems identified by `code` values in complete,
well-formed sentences and MAY provide suggestions or solutions. It is expected for `message` values
to duplicate information from `code`, `target`, and custom extensions to the error model.

Importantly, `message` values are still meant for _developers_ and for this reason SHOULD NOT be
localized or written for use in a user interface. Fields mentioned within a `message` SHOULD be
mentioned by exact field name (e.g., `first_name`, not "first name").

Consider the example above of an error `code` with value `invalid_color`. A poor `message` would be:

```json
"The color provided for `paint` was invalid."
```

Unlike the `code`, a `message` MAY prescribe a specific solution, thereby adding value. A better
message would be:

```json
"The color for `paint` must be `red` or `blue`."
```

As demonstrated in the above examples, `message` values SHOULD use the back-tick character to
enclose field names, parameter names, header names, and specific values.

## Robustness tradeoffs
{: #robustness-tradeoffs}

The robustness principle section has been moved to a [new page](/docs/api-handbook?topic=api-handbook-robustness), and
the previous guidance has been substantially repudiated.
