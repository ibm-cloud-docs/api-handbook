# Types

Types define particular kinds of values. Each field in a model MUST have exactly one type, and
fields of some types cannot be nullable, optional, or mutable. Types also govern how a value from
(or for) a particular field can be represented in JSON and in query parameters.

The following types are described below:

* [Identifier](#identifier)
* [Boolean](#boolean)
* [Integer](#integer)
* [Float](#float)
* [String](#string)
* [Date](#date)
* [Date/Time](#datetime)
* [CRN](#crn)
* [Enumeration](#enumeration)
* [Model](#model)
* [Array](#array)

## Identifier

The identifier type contains a value which identifies a resource. It MUST uniquely identify a
resource among all resources of the same type, and SHOULD uniquely identify a resource among all
resources in a system. Identifier values MAY be [RFC 4122](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122)
UUIDs and SHOULD be selected by the system to ensure uniqueness.

It is not required that all models have identifier values. However, a model which has an identifier
value MUST include it in a field named `id`. Fields other than the `id` field MAY have the
identifier type, but such fields MUST refer to other resources.

Fields of the identifier type MUST NOT be nullable, optional, or mutable.

### Return format
{: #identifier-return-format}

An identifier value MUST be returned as a JSON string.

### Accepted formats
{: #identifier-accepted-formats}

In request bodies and query parameters, identifier values SHOULD be matched case-insensitively.


## Boolean

The boolean type contains either a `true` or `false` value. In a model, fields of the boolean type
MUST NOT be nullable, but MAY be optional.

### Return format
{: #boolean-return-format}

A boolean value MUST be returned as the JSON keyword `true` or the JSON keyword `false`.[^json-keywords]

### Accepted formats
{: #boolean-accepted-formats}

#### Request bodies
{: #boolean-request-bodies}

* The JSON keyword `true` or the JSON keyword `false` MUST be considered a valid
  boolean.
* Any other value MUST be rejected with a `400` status code and appropriate error response model if
  the field is required and SHOULD be ignored otherwise, subject to [robustness
  considerations](/docs/api-handbook/design/errors.html#robustness-tradeoffs).

#### Query parameters
{: #boolean-query-parameters}

* The strings `true` and `false` MUST be case-insensitively matched as valid booleans.
* Any other string MUST be considered invalid and SHOULD cause the parameter to be ignored.


## Integer

The integer type provides for numeric values which can represented as signed 64-bit integers and
which may require guaranteed precision. In a model, fields of the integer type MAY be nullable and
MAY be optional.

### Return format
{: #integer-return-format}

An integer value MUST be returned as a JSON number and MUST NOT have a decimal point or use
scientific notation.

### Accepted formats
{: #integer-accepted-formats}

#### Request bodies
{: #integer-request-bodies}

* Any JSON number value which evaluates to an integer within the service providing an API MUST be
  considered a valid integer, but MAY be rejected by other validation rules.
* The `null` JSON keyword MAY be accepted if the field is nullable and MUST NOT be accepted
  otherwise.
* Any other value MUST be rejected with a `400` status code and appropriate error response model if
  the field is required and SHOULD be ignored otherwise, subject to [robustness
  considerations](/docs/api-handbook/design/errors.html#robustness-tradeoffs).

#### Query parameters
{: #integer-query-parameters}

* Any string containing a [valid JSON number](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159#section-6) value
  without a fractional or exponential value MUST be considered a valid integer.
* Any other string containing a valid JSON number (i.e., a string with a fractional or exponential
  value) MAY be used for comparative filtering but MUST NOT be considered an exact match.
* The lowercase string `null` MUST be considered a match for an explicitly null value.
* Any other string MUST be considered invalid and SHOULD cause the parameter to be ignored.


## Float

The float type provides for numeric values which cannot represented as signed 64-bit integers and
for which guaranteed precision is not required. In a model, fields of the float type MAY be nullable
and MAY be optional.

### Return format
{: #float-return-format}

A float value MUST be returned as a JSON number and MAY have a decimal point or use scientific
notation.

### Accepted formats
{: #float-accepted-formats}

#### Request bodies
{: #float-request-bodies}

* Any JSON number value MUST be considered a valid float, but MAY be rejected by other validation
  rules.
* The `null` JSON keyword MAY be accepted if the field is nullable and MUST NOT be accepted
  otherwise.
* Any other value MUST be rejected with a `400` status code and appropriate error response model if
  the field is required and SHOULD be ignored otherwise, subject to [robustness
  considerations](/docs/api-handbook/design/errors.html#robustness-tradeoffs).

#### Query parameters
{: #float-query-parameters}

* Any string containing a [valid JSON number](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159#section-6) value
  MUST be considered a valid float.
* The lowercase string `null` MUST be considered a match for an explicitly null value.
* Any other string MUST be considered invalid and SHOULD cause the parameter to be ignored.


## String

The string type provides for arbitrary strings of characters. Note that the string type referred to
here is not equivalent to a JSON string, as JSON strings are also used to represent dates,
date/times, and enumerations.

### Return format
{: #string-return-format}

A string value MUST be returned as a JSON string.

### Accepted formats
{: #string-accepted-formats}

All validation and comparison logic for strings is dictated by a model.


## Date

The date type specifies a particular year, month, and day.

### Return format
{: #date-return-format}

A date value MUST be returned as a JSON string containing a date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`,
matching the `full-date` format as [specified by RFC
3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6).

In this format:

* `YYYY` is a four-digit year value
* `MM` is a two-digit month value (`01`-`12`)
* `DD` is a two-digit day-of-the-month value (`01`-`31`)

### Accepted formats
{: #date-accepted-formats}

A date value matching the returned format MUST be considered a valid date. All other values MUST NOT
be considered valid. An invalid date in the request body MUST be rejected with a `400` status code
and appropriate error response model if the field is required and SHOULD be ignored otherwise,
subject to [robustness considerations](/docs/api-handbook/design/errors.html#robustness-tradeoffs).
An invalid date in a query parameter SHOULD cause the parameter to be ignored.


## Date/Time

The date/time type specifies a particular date, time, and timezone.

### Return format
{: #date-time-return-format}

A date/time value MUST be returned as a JSON string containing a date/time value in the format
`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ` or `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ`, matching the `date-time` format as [specified
by RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.6).

In these formats:

* `YYYY`, `MM`, and `DD` are as [described above](#date)
* `T` is a literal, uppercase "T"
* `HH` is the number of hours since midnight (`00`-`23`)
* `mm` is the number of minutes since the start of the hour (`00`-`59`)
* `ss` is the number of seconds since the start of the minute (`00`-`59`)
* `sss` is the number of milliseconds since the start of the second (`000`-`999`)
* `Z` is a literal, uppercase "Z", indicating no timezone offset (`±00:00` or UTC)

Date/time values SHOULD be returned with the same precision with which they are stored and MUST NOT
be returned with greater precision. I.e., if a date/time value is stored internally with
second-precision, it MUST NOT be returned in the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ` where `sss` is
always `000`.

If a date/time value is stored with millisecond-precision, but returned with second-precision, the
value MUST be truncated to second-precision prior to any client-facing operations, such as sorting.

### Accepted formats
{: #date-time-accepted-formats}

A date/time value which case-insensitively matches either of the valid date/time return formats MUST
be considered a valid date/time value. A date/time value provided by the client SHOULD NOT be
required to have the same precision—either second or millisecond—as the field returns.

Additionally, a date/time value provided as input SHOULD be permitted to supply an explicit timezone
offset in place of a literal `Z`. This offset MUST be formatted as `±HH:mm` where:

* `±` is a literal `+` or `-`
* `HH` is the number of whole hours by which the timezone differs from UTC
* `mm` is the number of additional minutes by which the timezone differs from UTC

In particularly delicate situations where input must be guaranteed to be correct, input with no
timezone offset (that is, input in UTC indicated by a literal `Z`) MAY be required.

All other values MUST NOT be considered valid. An invalid date/time value in the request body MUST
be rejected with a `400` status code and appropriate error response model if the field is required
and SHOULD be ignored otherwise, subject to [robustness
considerations](/docs/api-handbook/design/errors.html#robustness-tradeoffs). An invalid date/time
value in a query parameter SHOULD cause the parameter to be ignored.


## CRN

The CRN type provides for a Cloud Resource Name. CRN values MUST conform to the CRN specification
and MUST uniquely identify a resource among all resources.

It is not required that all models have CRN fields. However, a model which has an associated CRN
SHOULD include it in a field named `crn`. Any other field SHOULD NOT contain a CRN.

CRN fields MUST NOT be used in place of identifiers and MUST NOT be used to identify a resource in a
URI path segment.

### Return format
{: #crn-return-format}

A CRN value MUST be returned as a JSON string.

### Accepted formats
{: #crn-accepted-formats}

In request bodies and query parameters, CRN values SHOULD be matched case-sensitively.


## Enumeration

Enumerations are a category of types for specified sets of string values. Each individual
enumeration type is defined by the set of valid string values. For example, a model might define a
color enumeration allowing only the values `red`, `blue`, and `green`. Consequently, a field of the
color enumeration type could only contain one of those three values.

### Return format
{: #enumeration-return-format}

An enumeration value MUST be a member of the set of values defined for a particular enumeration
type. These values MUST be lower snake case strings and MUST begin with a letter and not a number.

### Accepted formats
{: #enumeration-accepted-formats}

A case-insensitive match for one of the defined values for an enumeration MUST be considered a valid
value but MAY be rejected by other validation rules.

All other values MUST NOT be considered valid. An invalid enumeration value in the request body MUST
be rejected with a `400` status code and appropriate error response model if the field is required
and SHOULD be ignored otherwise, subject to [robustness
considerations](/docs/api-handbook/design/errors.html#robustness-tradeoffs). An invalid enumeration
value in a query parameter SHOULD cause the parameter to be ignored.


## Array

Arrays are a category of types for collections of same-type values. Each individual array type is
defined as a collection of values of a specific type. For example, a model might specify a field
with an [integer](#integer) array type. Consequently, this field could only contain an array with
zero or more [integer](#integer) values.


## Model

To learn about models, see the [Models](/docs/api-handbook/design/models.html) section. Each
model—while itself a collection of fields with types—is also a type.

Because of this, one model can contain a field whose type is another model. For example, consider a
Server Model with a `processor` field. This field's type could be the Processor Model. Consequently,
an instance of the Server Model would contain an instance of the Processor Model in its `processor`
field.

[^json-keywords]: [In RFC 7159](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159#section-3), `true`, `false`, and
`null` values are called "literal names," but in this document we refer to them as "JSON keywords."
