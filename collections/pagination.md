# Pagination
{: #pagination}

Pagination MAY be implemented by any collection and is often desirable to provide faster responses
and smaller payloads to clients. Although not all collections are required to provide pagination, it
SHOULD be implemented for any collection where an unbounded number of resources may be present.

If a collection supports pagination, a request to that collection's URL without any query parameters
MUST return the first page of resources.[^pagination-unspecified]

## Pagination and stable order
{: #pagination-and-stable-order}

In order to ensure paginated collections have a stable order, the server MUST sort collections on a
unique value by default and, if necessary, supplement any requested sorting with a sort on a unique
value (typically a primary key).[^pagination-and-sorting]

For example, if the client wishes to sort on `last_name`, and the last name is not guaranteed to be
unique, the system could implicitly sort on `last_name` and then `id` (where `id` is unique).

## Pagination links
{: #pagination-links}

In the scenarios specified below, paginated collections MUST return the fields `first`, `previous`,
`next`, and `last` in the collection object. When present, each of these fields MUST contain an
object with an `href` field containing a URL for the first, previous, next, or last page,
respectively. The URLs in these fields MUST be complete and begin with a protocol (e.g.,
`https://api.example.com/v2/accounts?offset=200&limit=50`).

The `first` link SHOULD be included for all pages (including the first and last pages).

The `next` link MUST be included for all pages except the last page, or pages "after" the last page.

The `previous` link SHOULD be included for all pages except the first page. If the pagination
implementation makes paging in reverse expensive or impractical, the `previous` link MAY be omitted.

The `last` link SHOULD be included for all pages (including the first and last pages). If it is
expensive or impractical to provide a `last` page link, the `last` link MAY be omitted.

When any of the above fields are omitted, they should be absent from the response entirely and not
included with `null` values. A request made to a `next` or `previous` URL MUST NOT affect the
response of a subsequent request to the same URL.

## Token-based pagination
{: #token-based-pagination}

Collections SHOULD implement token-based pagination wherever practical, but MAY implement
offset and limit pagination when deemed necessary for collection use-cases.

Token-based pagination MUST support a page token query parameter, which SHOULD be named `start`
but MAY be named `token`, for accepting a page token that specifies the resource
to start the page on or after.
The collection MAY also support the `limit` query parameter.

Page tokens MUST be `string` values and SHOULD be presented as opaque values. If it is impractical
for page tokens to be opaque, clients SHOULD still be discouraged from generating their own tokens.
Page tokens MUST have an enforced maximum length and that length SHOULD be documented and SHOULD be
no more than 512 characters.

A request made using a page token from `next`, `previous`, or `last` MUST NOT affect the response of a
subsequent request using the same page token.

If a page token is passed in the page token query parameter of a request, the service MUST fail the
request if any other parameters of the request are not consistent with the page token.

Token-based pagination can be implemented in a number of ways (including keyset pagination or
cursor-based pagination). However, any implementation of token-based pagination SHOULD attempt to
ensure that resources are not duplicated or omitted[^duplication-or-omission] if all pages in a
collection are requested in sequence.

### Page token query parameter
{: #page-token-query-parameter}

The page token query parameter, which SHOULD be named `start` but MAY be named `token`,
MUST be used to determine what resource to start the page on or after.
If the page token query parameter is unspecified, the logical first page of results MUST be returned.

Page tokens SHOULD be provided to the client in the page token field, having the same name as
the page token query parameter, of the `next`, `previous`, or `last` object in a collection.

### Limit
{: #limit-with-page-token}

The collection MAY support the `limit` query parameter, which MUST be an integer.
When supported, the `limit` parameter MUST be used to determine the maximum number of resources returned.
Further, the number of resources returned SHOULD be the same as `limit` except for the last
page of the collection.

If `limit` is unspecified or unsupported by the collection, a default limit MUST be used. The
default limit MUST be consistent across all requests to the collection. It should be determined for
each collection based on a reasonable default request time and payload size. The default limit
should be highlighted in the collection's documentation.

If `limit` is supported, a collection MUST impose a maximum value for the limit. The maximum limit
MUST be consistent across all requests to the collection. The maximum limit should be determined for
each collection based on reasonable maximums for request time and payload size. The maximum limit
should be highlighted in the collection's documentation.

If the value provided for `limit` is not a positive integer or is greater than the maximum limit,
the server SHOULD return a `400` status code and appropriate error response model.

### Additional response fields
{: #additional-response-fields-with-token}

Collections using token-based pagination MUST return a page token field, having the same name
as the page token query parameter, in any `next`, `previous`, and `last` fields whenever these
are present according the conditions defined for [Link-based pagination](#link-based-pagination).
The value of the page token field can be passed in the page token query parameter
on a subsequent request to retrieve the next, previous, or last page of results, respectively.

There is no need for a page token field in `first` since the first page of results can be obtained by
simply omitting the page token query parameter from the request.

If the `limit` query parameter is supported, the `limit` MUST be included in the collection
response. The value for this field MUST be an integer, and MUST be included whether it was
explicitly provided by the user or provided by a default.

A `total_count` field MAY also be included in the collection response. If present, this field MUST
contain an integer representing the total number of resources in the collection (accounting for
filtering, but not for paging). If it is expensive or impractical to provide a `total_count` value,
the `total_count` field SHOULD be omitted.

### Accuracy and consistency
{: #accuracy-and-consistency}

If it is deemed critical that a client be able to retrieve all pages without any duplicated or
omitted resources, one of two approaches MAY be implemented:

1. Pagination MAY be performed across an ephemeral snapshot of the collection made with the first
   request and referenced by the token.[^snapshot-reference] This approach guarantees that all
   pages in a paginated set represent the resources in the collection at the time of the initial
   request.
2. A paginated collection MAY require that sorting be performed only on immutable fields, while
   each request is still made against live data. This approach guarantees that all resources that
   existed for the entire duration of paginated requests are neither omitted nor duplicated if all
   pages in a collection are requested in sequence.

### Example token-based pagination response
{: #example-token-based-pagination-response}

```json
{
  "limit": 50,
  "total_count": 232,
  "first": {
    "href": "https://api.example.com/v2/accounts?limit=50"
  },
  "next": {
    "href": "https://api.example.com/v2/accounts?start=3fe78a36b9aa7f26&limit=50",
    "start": "3fe78a36b9aa7f26"
  },
  "accounts": [
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Offset and limit pagination
{: #offset-and-limit-pagination}

Offset and limit pagination MUST support two query parameters: `offset` and `limit`.

### Offset
{: #offset}

The `offset` parameter MUST be used to determine how many resources to skip over, given the order of
the collection. If `offset` is unspecified, the response MUST be identical to the response where
`offset` is explicitly provided as `0`.

Any non-negative integer MUST be a valid value for the `offset` parameter. If the supplied `offset`
is greater than or equal to the total number of resources present, the server MUST return an empty
collection, and MUST NOT return an `400`- or `500`-series response code.

If the value provided for `offset` is _not_ a non-negative integer, the server SHOULD return a
`400` status code and appropriate error response model.

### Limit
{: #limit-with-offset}

The `limit` parameter MUST determine how many resources are returned, unless the offset and limit
are such that the response is the last page[^last-page] of resources.

If `limit` is unspecified, a default limit MUST be used. The default limit MUST be consistent across
all requests to the collection. It should be determined for each collection based on a reasonable
default request time and payload size. The default limit should be highlighted in the collection's
documentation.

A paginated collection MUST impose a maximum value for the limit. The maximum limit MUST be
consistent across all requests to the collection.[^maximum-limit-consistency] The maximum limit
should be determined for each collection based on reasonable maximums for request time and payload
size.[^maximum-limit] The maximum limit should be highlighted in the collection's documentation.

If the value provided for `limit` is not a positive integer, or if the value provided is greater
than the maximum value for the collection, the server SHOULD return a `400` status code and
appropriate error response model. 

### Additional response fields
{: #additional-response-fields-with-offset}

The fields `offset` and `limit` MUST be included in the collection response. The values for these
fields MUST be integers, and MUST be included whether they were explicitly provided by the user or
provided by defaults.

A `total_count` field SHOULD also be included in the collection response. If present, this field
MUST contain an integer representing the total number of resources in the collection (accounting for
filtering, but not for paging). If it is expensive or impractical to provide a `total_count` value,
the `total_count` field MAY be omitted.

### Example offset and limit pagination response
{: #example-offset-and-limit-pagination-response}

```json
{
  "offset": 100,
  "limit": 50,
  "total_count": 232,
  "first": {
    "href": "http://api.example.com/v2/accounts?limit=50"
  },
  "last": {
    "href": "http://api.example.com/v2/accounts?offset=200&limit=50"
  },
  "previous": {
    "href": "http://api.example.com/v2/accounts?offset=50&limit=50"
  },
  "next": {
    "href": "http://api.example.com/v2/accounts?offset=150&limit=50"
  },
  "accounts": [
    ...
  ]
}
```

[^pagination-unspecified]: That is, a paged collection should never return all resources if paging
   parameters are unspecified.

[^pagination-and-sorting]: If the records returned in a paginated request have arbitrary ordering,
   the client has no assurance that a particular page corresponds to specific records.

[^last-page]: The "last page" is defined as the scenario where the sum of the supplied offset and
   limit is greater than the total number of resources in the collection.

[^maximum-limit-consistency]: That is, the maximum limit must not change based on any other request
   parameters; it may vary for different collections, but not for different request parameters on
   one collection.

[^maximum-limit]: Without a maximum limit, it may be possible for clients to (intentionally or not)
   inundate a system with prohibitively expensive requests.

[^duplication-or-omission]: There are two possible exceptions to this rule. First, if the resources
   are being ordered based on mutable fields, and the value of one or more of those fields changes
   for a particular resource in between page requests, it is acceptable for that resource to be
   duplicated or omitted as an artifact of that change. Second, if a resource is added to the
   collection after the initial request or removed prior to the final request, it is acceptable for
   it to be omitted from the complete set of pages.

[^snapshot-reference]: Note that the token must still refer to a particular page of the snapshot
   such that multiple requests made with the same token yield the same results.
