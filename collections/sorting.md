# Sorting
{: #sorting}

Custom sorting MAY be implemented by any collection, but is likely to be far more useful for
paginated collections where sort order impacts which resources fall on each page. It is OPTIONAL for
any collection, paginated or not, to provide custom sorting.[^custom-sorting-optional]

Collections which provide custom sorting MUST do so via the `sort` query parameter. Depending on
usefulness, a collection MAY support either single-field or multi-field sorting. The documentation
for the collection should highlight any fields which are available for sorting, including
first-level primitive fields and primitive fields of embedded resources. The `.` character MUST be
used to delineate sub-resources and sub-fields.

## Single-field sorting
{: #single-field-sorting}

Collections that support single-field sorting MUST allow the `sort` parameter to contain any one of
the valid sort fields. For example, the following expression would sort accounts on company name
(ascending):

`GET /v2/accounts?sort=company_name`

The client MUST also be able to prefix the field with a `-` character[^plus-deprecated], indicating
a descending sort order. For example, the expression below would sort on the last name of the
account owner, in descending order:

`GET /v2/accounts?sort=-owner.last_name`

If the `-` prefix is not provided, the sort MUST be done in ascending order.

An unrecognized or unsupported sort field SHOULD result in a `400` status code and appropriate
error response model.

## Multi-field sorting
{: #multi-field-sorting}

Collections that support sorting on multiple fields MUST allow the `sort` parameter to contain a
comma-separated sequence of fields (each, optionally, with a `-` prefix) in the same format as
described above for single-field sorting. Sorts MUST be applied to the data set in the order that
they are provided. For example, the expression below would sort accounts first on company name
(ascending) and second on owner last name (descending):

`GET /v2/accounts?sort=company_name,-owner.last_name`

An unrecognized or unsupported sort field or a repeated sort field SHOULD result in a `400` status
code and appropriate error response model.

[^custom-sorting-optional]: It is worth noting, however, that paginated collections [must
   provide](/docs/api-handbook?topic=api-handbook-pagination#pagination-and-sorting)
   at least a default sort and supplement any custom sorts to ensure a consistent order.

[^plus-deprecated]: A previous version of the API Handbook recommended that a `+` prefix also be
   supported to explicitly request ascending order. This is no longer recommended for APIs except to
   maintain backward-compatibility.
