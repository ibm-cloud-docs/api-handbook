# Filtering
{: #filtering}

Filtering MAY be implemented for collections where clients need to limit the resources returned by
specific criteria.

## Basic filtering
{: #basic-filtering}

Basic filtering provides the ability for the client to specify one or more filters where each
supported field is required to match a specific value. Any primitive field returned by a collection
MAY be supported for filtering.

The query parameter names for a basic filter MUST match the name of a primitive field on a resource
in the collection exactly or a nested primitive field where the `.` character is the hierarchical
separator. The only exception to this rule is for [primitive arrays](#primitive-arrays).

The resulting collection MUST satisfy all filters. For example, the below filters would return only
users whose first name is "John" _and_ last name is "Smith":

`GET /v2/users?first_name=John&last_name=Smith`

### Matching logic
{: #matching-logic}

Guidance for matching logic varies by field type, and is provided under the accepted formats heading
for each type in the [Types](/docs/api-handbook?topic=api-handbook-types) section.

### Primitive arrays
{: #primitive-arrays}

Primitive arrays (such as `tags`) MAY support a singular form of the field (such as `tag`) as a
filter that matches the resource if the array contains the supplied value. For example, the below
filter could return the result following:

`GET /v2/users?tag=swift`

```json
{
  "resources": [
    {
      "email": "john.smith@ibm.com",
      "first_name": "John",
      "last_name": "Smith",
      "tags": ["objective-c", "swift", "ruby", "elixir"]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Extended filtering
{: #extended-filtering}

The following types MAY support the below extended filters:

### Numeric fields
{: #numeric-fields}

Numeric fields MAY support the following comparisons:

*  Not equal, by prefixing a value with `not:`
*  Greater than, by prefixing a value with `gt:`
*  Greater than or equal, by prefixing a value with `gte:`
*  Less than, by prefixing a value with `lt:`
*  Less than or equal, by prefixing a value with `lte:`
*  In a set, by providing a comma-separated list of values
*  Not in a set, by prefixing a comma-separated list of values with `not:`

If any integer or float field supports any of the above comparisons, all integer and float fields
which the collection can be filtered on MUST support all of the above comparisons.

### Date and date/time fields
{: #date-and-date-time-fields}

Date and date/time fields MAY support the following comparisons:

*  Not equal, by prefixing a value with `not:`
*  Greater than, by prefixing a value with `gt:`
*  Greater than or equal, by prefixing a value with `gte:`
*  Less than, by prefixing a value with `lt:`
*  Less than or equal, by prefixing a value with `lte:`
*  In a set, by providing a comma-separated list of values
*  Not in a set, by prefixing a comma-separated list of values with `not:`

If any date or date/time field supports any of the above comparisons, all date and date/time fields
which the collection can be filtered on MUST support all of the above comparisons.

### Identifier and enumeration fields
{: #identifier-and-enumeration-fields}

Identifier and enumeration fields MAY support the following comparisons:

*  Not equal, by prefixing a value with `not:`
*  In a set, by providing a comma-separated list of values
*  Not in a set, by prefixing a comma-separated list of values with `not:`

If any enumeration or identifier field supports any of the above comparisons, all enumeration and
identifier fields which the collection can be filtered on MUST support all of the above comparisons.
Identifier and enumeration values MUST be matched case-insensitively.

### String fields
{: #string-fields}

String fields MAY implicitly match fields which _contain_ the provided value instead of requiring an
exact match. String field matching also MAY be case-insensitive. Additionally, string fields MAY
support prefixing a value with `not:` in order to invert the default matching logic.

## Advanced querying
{: #advanced-querying}

Careful consideration should be given to providing any advanced query syntax. It is preferred that
any syntax exposed not constrain future technology choices to a specific backend technology. For
this reason, services SHOULD expose only a well-specified, standardized query syntax. If the service
itself parses queries, care should be taken that it does so in a robust, secure manner.
